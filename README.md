## About

Completed the entire data analysis process on a “No-show appointments” dataset then communicated the findings about it using Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib):
-	Downloaded the dataset and wrangled the data.
-	Carried out an exploratory data analysis.
-	Created related visualizations.
-	Made conclusions on the factors important to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment.
